*A plugin for Autodesk's Fusion 360 CAD-CAM software.*

As a Fusion 360 instructor and active maker, I realized the need for an automated tab joints and living hinges generator. I wrote those two plugins to accelerate the process in the native environment.

## Install

This project is now limited to the Sketch environment only but has the possibility to expand to the Solid environment.

<!-- Tab Joint transforms a sketchline into a male or female tab joint pattern where you can configure many characteristics.

Living Hinge creates a sketchline pattern within a user defined area where you can configure many characteristics.

While writing those two plugins, I've learned a lot about the mathematics related to the subjects. It was quite challenging to keep it simple to use for the users.

One of the best features, according to the users, is the possibility to define a kerf tolerance for the laser cutter. -->
