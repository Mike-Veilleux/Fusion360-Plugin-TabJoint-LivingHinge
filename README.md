# Tab Joint & Living Hinge generator 

*A plugin for Autodesk's Fusion 360 CAD-CAM software.*


I use to teach and use Fusion 360 on a dayly basis and realized that there was a lot of time spent on creating tab joint and lining hinge. I wrote those two plugin to accelerate the process in the native environement.

Tab Joint transform a sketchline into a male or female tab joint pattern where you can configue many characteristics.

Living Hinge create a sketchline pattern within a user defined area where you can configure many characteristics.

While writing those two plugins, I've learn a lot about the mathematics related to the subjects. It was quite challangin to keep it simple to use for the users.

One of the best features, according to the users, is the posiibility to define a kerf tolerance for the laser cutter.

This project is now limited to the Sketch environement only but has possibiility to expand to the Solid environement.
